## ðŸ“” About

Ghost is a Discord bot for the Spirit Studios Discord server.
It has a few features, including:
- Music playback from either Soundcloud or Bandcamp
- A tag system allowing us to respond quickly to FAQs
- A command to fetch mod info from Modrinth (WIP)

## Special Thanks
To Mojang (yes, that mojang).

Ghost's internal architecture is heavily based on that of Minecraft (specifically the registry system). It also uses Mojang's serialization library DataFixerUpper in places (and may eventually use it for command arguments if I get around to it).
