Essential is a mod that claims to be the... essential mod for Minecraft. Unfortunately, it has many incompatibility issues and uses predatory practices to make as much money as possible from its users.

While Essential is aiming to be the only Minecraft mod you'll ever need, that job becomes very hard once you realise that it is, in fact, not the only Minecraft mod you'll ever need. And once you realise that, it becomes harder to justify the incompatibilities it causes because if the mod crashes and there are other alternatives that don't crash, why bother using this mod at all?

The mod is provided under their own source-available license, stating that you cannot do any of the following (without breaking the license):

- Modify the source code. Even if you need to fix an incompatibility, or just make their code better.
- Use the code in any other project, or as a base for a new project. This means no forks. Ever.

Essential has many other ~~features~~issues that make it even more undesirable, such as:

- A store with a coin bundle system, making users feel like they are spending less money than they actually are.
- An ads program for multiplayer servers, many of which promote underage gambling via loot boxes, crate keys, and more.
- Breaking compatibility with many content mods, which would be fine if they actually let you fix it.
- Requiring acceptance of a ToS and Privacy Policy which allows them to collect tons of unnecessary data from you.

A constantly updated list of why not to use Essential, as well as alternatives to Essential for later versions, can be found [here](https://notessential.blurry.gay/).
